Project Apollo is a Pythonic re-imagining of HTML Canvas element implementations depending on browser specific middlewares to support OpenGL rendering; named so after Apollo's mythological encounter with the very same Serpent.

# Contributing

At present Apollo is a work of speculative fiction, the answers to if this is practically feasible are still at large and much research is yet to be done. With this in mind, it's worth mentioning that this leaves considerable flexibility in the form it assumes when script meets compiler so all are welcome however, please ensure you take due care in adhering to the edit syntax outlined below:

- All documentation/research orientated edits are to be made via the BoostNote [here](https://boostnote.io/sgnyfbfcg/workspaces/Apollo-wPd59f6798e142411a818720be71542d9b) - Doing so will ensure that any insights/analysis shared remains organised + easily accessible to all contributors.
- When making edits please remember to submit a PR - Be proud of what you've done!
-  Finally, especially when findings are ambiguous, your confidence in analysis is low or a clear conclusion is unable to be made ***please*** make sure you convey this clearly in any submissions/edits so that future works aren't built on false assumptions - Sticking to this will ensure we're all on the same page going forwards!
